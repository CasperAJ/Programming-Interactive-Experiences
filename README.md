# Insert Project title

This project were made for the educational programming class "Programming Interactive Experiences" as part of Computer Science & Informatics, hence the name.

## Vision 
The projects vision is to create "seamless" way to unlock your door through you mobile phone, purely based on it's presence.

If you like me, have keys for many houses or buildings, then your set of keys can become quite huge and heavy, and bothersom to carry around.
Hence it would be nice if any door you come near, simply unlocks for you, either on it's own (yes magic exicsts, its called science), or by clicking a button, eliminating the need for you to fumble with a half hundred keys, to fint he right one, as well as having to carry the keys arond in the first place.

I will show you, how I have managed to make a **prototype** of this magical wonder.
If you wonna see how the end result looks like, then click **[HERE](#end-result)**


## What you need
To follow what I have done, you'll be needing the following

* 1 breadboard                - I'll be using & suggest a board between 10-30
* 1 Wemos with a Wi-Fi chip   - I'll be using a model "ESP 8266" ( the important part is Wi-Fi capabilities)
* 1 Servo + it's moutings     - I'll be using a model "Tower Pro MG995 - Digi HI-Speed"
* 1 Button                    - Clickedy click
* 6-8 cables                  - I'll let you pick your own colours. I'll be using 2 red, 2 brown, 1 orange, 1 purple, 1 grey & 1 black
* Acces to a gluegun
* Access to a laser cutter    - Pew Pew \*laser gun noise\*
* Access to box material      - I'll be using 3mm wood
* Access to a 3D printer      - A small one, one that can print 5x5cm
* Access to a sodder station  - I'll be asuming that you know how to sodder
* Access to a drill           - Either hand or stationary should do
* Access to [makercase.com](http://www.makercase.com/) - To design your own case
