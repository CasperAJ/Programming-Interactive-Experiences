# Insert Project title

This project were made for the educational programming class "Programming Interactive Experiences" as part of Computer Science & Informatics, hence the name.

## Vision 
The projects vision is to create "seamless" way to unlock your door through you mobile phone, purely based on it's presence.

If you like me, have keys for many houses or buildings, then your set of keys can become quite huge and heavy, and bothersom to carry around.
Hence it would be nice if any door you come near, simply unlocks for you, either on it's own (yes magic exicsts, its called science), or by clicking a button, eliminating the need for you to fumble with a half hundred keys, to fint he right one, as well as having to carry the keys arond in the first place.

I will show you, how I have managed to make a **prototype** of this magical wonder.

## what you need
To follow what I have done you will be needing the following
(similar materials and items can be used ofcause, but may not work entirely as mine)
* 1 Wemos with a wifi chip - I'll be using a model ESP 8266 ( the important part is wifi capabilities)
