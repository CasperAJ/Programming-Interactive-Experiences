# Insert Project title

This project were made for the educational programming class "Programming Interactive Experiences" as part of Computer Science & Informatics, hence the name.

## Vision 
The projects vision is to create "seamless" way to unlock your door through you mobile phone, purely based on it's presence.
If you like me, have keys for many houses or buildings, then your set of keys can become quite huge and heavy, and quite bothersom to carry around

I will show you, I have managed to make a prototype of this, based on a wemos board, some home made code, a wifi-sniffer, waasd

## what you need
